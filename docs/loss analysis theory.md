"the approximation that Rs only shifts Vmpp and Rsh only shifts Jmpp"

absolute error in \Delta FF is < 0.2 % for:

Rs < 2 Ohm.cm2
Rsh > 200 Ohm.cm2


Note that FFo here is different to Green's model in [green1982accuracy]

khanna:
ideal -> FF_J01
'resistance free' -> FF_0

Green:
ideal -> FF_0
